    <div class=field><div class=key>Synthesis Notes</div><div class=value>We mostly adopt Orjuela & Meira's analysis, with some slight differences. The phonemic inventory is taken from O&M (which they mostly adopt from Duarte 2007), and contains no contrastive nasal vowels. Based on data in O&M's Table 2 (p. 5), we assume that venting occurs to word-initial /d/ --> [nd], despite the fact that the authors do not discuss this phonological process. Pre-oralization of word-final /N/ happens after oral vowels--this process seems to be most frequent for word-final Ns. Post-oralization of /N/ before oral vowels also seems to occur sometimes, despite the fact that O&M don't discuss it--this is surprising, as the second spectrogram from Figure 1 clearly shows a post-oralized [mb]. Finally, O&M claim that Tembé exhibits nasals with oral explosion [m͈, n͈] in pre-vocalic position, but the evidence for this is equivocal based on the available spectrograms, where the burst is not nearly as clear as in the orally-exploded nasals observed in Karitiâna (see Demolin, Haude & Storto 2006). It may be that some cases of what they describe as orally-exploded nasals are actually post-oralized nasals, but more data is needed to determine whether or not this is the case. Orjuela & Meira actually seem to have thought the same thing at some point, as the spectrograms on p. 7 show transcriptions with both post-oralized [mb] and circumoralized [bmb] for the word 'collared peccary', which is transcribed in Table on p.6 with oral explosion.  Venting seems to be present for some of the data: /daku/ 'bird sp', /dapu/ 'bird sp', and /danu/ 'spider', which can surface with pre-nasalized stops: [ⁿdaku] 'bird sp', [ⁿdapu] 'bird sp', and [ⁿdanu] 'spider' (p. 5) but this analysis is not expanded on.  In a /VN/ sequence, the output can be either [VDN] or [ṼN]. This has been coded using the following input-output mappings: {V, {V, Ṽ}, /VN/, {ṼN, VDN}}, {N, {N, DN}, /VN/, {ṼN, VDN}}. It seems that pre-oralization can occur with /m, n, ŋ/, but perhaps not with /ŋʷ/ given the absence of a datapoint with a pre-oralized [gŋʷ]. We also note that, while in our version of Orjuela & Meira's ms. there is also no datapoint exemplifying pre-oralized /n/ as [dn], Baraúna (2016) cites the following example [ǝkǝpin]~[ǝkǝpidn] ‘pássaro local’ from Orjuela & Meira's manuscript. We suspect that we may have access to a slightly different version of manuscript, as this same datapoint is transcribed as [əkəˈpĩn] in our version. Nonetheless, we infer from this that pre-oralization also applies to alveolar /n/. We also note that while there is no datapoint in the ms. that exemplifies vowel nasalization (LN) triggered by /ŋʷ/, we simply assume that /ŋʷ/ does nasalize adjacent vowels in the same way as other nasal consonants.</div></div>
